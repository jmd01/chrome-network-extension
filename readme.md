#Network+ browser extension

Network+ is a Chrome and Firefox extension that provides additional filtering options for network request and response objects.

It allows network requests to be filtered and sorted by the response and request content.

This is particularly helpful when debugging GraphQL applications, where the query or mutation name is not part of the url (as in REST APIs), but instead is passed within the post data.

Network+ also provides filtering operations on the response body.

Filters included:
* contains, doesn't contains
* starts with
* ends with
* =
* !=
* >
* >=
* <
* <=
